      "message": "a lot of linting issues here\n\nI don\u0027t really get the need of using the timestamp. I see that there are 2 types of \u0027viewed\u0027 flag for notification: viewed in toaster and viewed in validations list.\n\nso the workflow is: notification is raised, gets stored in store. \nNotificationList watches the store and fires notificationsViewed action when user closes it. Store updates it\u0027s notifications accordingly.\n\nToaster watches store, displays the first unviewed notification and starts timeout. when timeout finishes, fires notificationViewedInToaster and store updates the notification accordingly in state.\n\nNote: I think we are complicating stuff a bit too much with marking notifications as viewed in notification list. I don\u0027t think this is really necessary in the development phase the application is at the moment.\n\nThe whole notifications management seems to be very complicated while I\u0027d much rather keep it as simple as possible so we are ready to swiftly accept changes which will eventually come.",

      "message": "OK, so this has changed from how it previously worked. Here is how it should work now:\n\nNotification gets raised, viewed is set to false.\n\nToaster sees the change and displays the latest notification. \n\nIf there is more than one \u0027new\u0027 notification, they get queued for display, most recent to oldest. \n\nWe now timestamp when the notification comes in so we can display them in the correct order.\n\nThe viewed flag is not affected by the toaster. \n\nThere will be an indicator in the footer to show the user how many unread notifications there are currently.\n\nThe timestamp will be shown in the notifications list.\n\nThe notifications list will highlight unread notifications.\n\nOnce the user closes the notifications list all notifications will be marked viewed and the unread count on the footer indicator will go to 0.",
