So there needs to be some process indicator. \n  We also need to make sure, upload button is\n  not activated until last file is processed. \n* Show the list after the last file has been processed. \n  PRO: Only one DOM-Update\n  CON: Waiting time until the list is shown. There should be \n  some indicator showing that files are currently being \n  processed.",
