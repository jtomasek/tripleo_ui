      "message": "hmm, it makes no sense to put container-fluid to this div and then immediatelly override it.\n\ncontainer-fluid should be put to div.wrapper-fixed-footer and since we want to use grid, we should organize everything in footer in grid. It is not big issue and makes everything clean - set of rows + columns\n\nIn places where we don\u0027t want to have columns, we use just row and the full width is available\n\nput rows to div which wraps drawer-toggle and drawer-nav and to drawer-content. drawer content then does not need widh 100% and overflow-y\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/6i664dnfix3pxyo/Screenshot%20from%202016-01-20%2018-42-55.png?dl\u003d0",
