      "message": "This way, we are limiting the plan processing only on moments when listPlans is triggered. which will force us running this action to trigger the processing.\n\nIt would be probably better to put the processing to the component (AuthenticatedContent) which would do the processing on every PlanStore change and trigger the necessary actions (choosePlan) if they are needed.\n\nSo in the end this service would not be needed",

      "message": "The reason I hooked it into the listPlans action is that plan-detection depends on that list. There\u0027s no way to activate a plan from a clean slate without knowing which plans exist. (Even if there\u0027s a plan stored in localStorage it still makes sense to retrieve the list to make sure the name in localStorage still exists as a plan.)\n\nBut of course I can do it the other way round: Call listPlans from the AuthContent component and then react to the changes in the PlansStore. But we\u0027d still need the initial listPlans call. Or am I missing something?\n\nJust one thing to think about: Should we keep the detection logic in the service to keep it semantically separated from the more general AuthContent component or just move everything to the component and get rid of the plan?",

      "message": "Yes, it does depend on listPlans. It is fine to call that from AuthenticatedContent as we do now. It happens only when component mounts - this spins the wheel initially and from now on it is just on the component reacts to the changes in store, processes current plan and fires necessary actions.\n\nI\u0027ll leave it up to you if you want to keep the service and call it from the component. IMO it is ok to put it into method on the AuthenticatedComponent because that is only thing that that component does now. If it grows, we can refactor.",
