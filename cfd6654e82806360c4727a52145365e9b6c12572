      "message": "Yes, if we intend to keep the modal open until the plan is actually deleted (ajax promise finishes) I think it is not required, so In this patch I remove the plan from the list by calling PlansActions.removePlan. In case the plan does not get removed, it will raise the notification and the plan re-appears in the list. I think this speeds up the interaction quite a lot.\n\nI am currently playing with the idea of putting the plan in the list to \u0027deleting\u0027 transitional state, so I display it appropriately in the list as \u0027hey, I am the plan which you initiated deletion of and I am in process of deleting so you can\u0027t really do anything with me\u0027\n\nThis way the UI would reflect the actual situation more. I am currently figuring out how to deal with the required changes in the store.\n\nWe might eventually apply this also for create/edit plan, but I think testing it out with deletion first is better.",
